Installing CUDA Toolkit 6.5 on Ubuntu 14.04 Linux

The following explains how to install CUDA Toolkit 6.5 on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 Linux. I have tested it on a self-assembled desktop with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 550 Ti graphics card. The instruction assumes you have the necessary CUDA compatible hardware support. Depending on your system configuration, your mileage may vary.

CUDA Repository

Retrieve the CUDA repository package for Ubuntu 14.04 from the CUDA download site and install it in a terminal.
$ sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_6.5-14_amd64.deb 
$ sudo apt-get update

CUDA Toolkit

Then you can install the CUDA Toolkit using apt-get.
$ sudo apt-get install cuda

You should reboot the system afterwards and verify the driver installation with the nvidia-settings utility.

Environment Variables

As part of the CUDA environment, you should add the following in the .bashrc file of your home folder.
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-6.5 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64 
 
PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH} 
export PATH

CUDA SDK Samples

Now you can copy the SDK samples into your home directory, and proceed with the build process.
$ cuda-install-samples-6.5.sh  ~ 
$ cd ~/NVIDIA_CUDA-6.5_Samples 
$ make

If everything goes well, you should be able to verify your CUDA installation by running the deviceQuery sample in bin/x86_64/linux/release.
